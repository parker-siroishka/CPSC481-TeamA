CPSC 481 - Human Computer Interaction I: Team A (Online Portfolio)

This stage of the user-centered design project is where we begin creating physical representations of the ideas that have been floating around our heads these last two stages.
We materialize these ideas through:

- Brainstorming Sessions (Located in "/Brainstorming Sketches") where we discussed and drew anything and everything that came to our mind. Once we had a clearer image of what we wanted to create, we created an Affinity Diagram
- Affinity Diagram (Located in "/Affinity Diagram & Supporting Files") where we extracted the underlying ideas of the sketches and goruped them into possible layouts and functional groupings of our application.
- Polished Ideas
- Storyboard
- Low-Fidelity Prototype
- Cognitive Walkthrough
- Prototype Demo
- Project Presentation
